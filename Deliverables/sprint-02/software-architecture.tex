\noindent {\large The OpenID Connect Doctor is a standalone CLI tool, that should be able to run on as many Operating Systems as possible. Furthermore, the application is required to work without the user having to install any additional programs. For this reason, it was decided, that the OpenID Connect Doctor should consist of only a single NodeJS application and use as few dependencies as possible. As the OpenID Connect Doctor must request tokens from an authorization server using OpenID Connect, it requires an interface to connect to a given authorization server using REST. To fully fulfill its task, the OpenID Connect Doctor is split into multiple smaller internal components, which carry out different tasks like requesting a token, decoding a token, etc. }

The code of the application will consist of multiple smaller classes, that each are responsible for a certain part of the application:
\begin{description}
\item[authflowConnector]: This class will contain the logic to send HTTP-requests to the different Identity-Providers and process the returned HTTP-response (e.g. for the different OIDC-Login-Flows).
\item[tokenDecoder]: This class will contain the logic to decode and transform the received access and id-tokens into a format that can be analyzed by the rest of the application.
\item[tokenAnalyzer]: This class will contain the logic to analyze the prepared information and report these information to the user (e.g. via the terminal or a logfile)
\item[authflowAnalyzer]: This class will reference the other three class and will be responsible for orchestrating the different functions. Additionally it will also include input-validation, global error-handling and configuration.
\end{description}
The reason for this split is to keep a certain level of separation between the different parts of the software, so it is easier to modify and test them.
